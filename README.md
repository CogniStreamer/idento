# Idento

Idento wants to be a complete, manageable OpenID Connect server for adding Single Sign On (SSO) functionality to your project. It is based on the popular IdentityServer3 and ASP.NET Identity but adds a user-interface for managing apps, external login providers (like Facebook, LinkedIn, Outlook, Google, etc), users, roles and claims.

Idento will also include user self-service where users can manage their credentials, applications and link/unlink their external logins.

## DO NOT USE JUST YET

This project is in a early development stage and is far from complete. A lot of code still needs to be written and existing code will change. This said, don't hesitate to star/follow the project if you want to be kept up-to-date.
